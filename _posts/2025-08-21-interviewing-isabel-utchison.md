Isabel was deep in the world of neuroscience – researching sleep and memory, publishing theoretical papers… chasing an academic career seemed inevitable. 
In this episode, we trace her path from late nights staring into EGG waves and postdoc life in Chicago to building an AR sports app that teaches kids skill moves through dance. Isabel talks candidly about creative frustration in academia, the slow pace of science, and her unexpected plunge into entrepreneurship.

We explore how she taught herself data science, found a co-founder by pure chance, and began building a startup from scratch. And we ask: what kind of resilience does it take to leave the comfort of research behind, face rejection, fundraise as a woman in tech and still believe in the thing you’re building?
