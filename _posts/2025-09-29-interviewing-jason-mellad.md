In this episode, we meet Jason – a life scientist turned consultant, biotech CEO, and venture investor – whose career has been anything but linear.

Raised by a scientist and a social worker-entrepreneur, Jason always knew he was a blend of two worlds. But it took years (and a few sharp pivots) to stop forcing himself into the mould of what a “real academic” (a hammer) should look like and start playing towards his own strengths (a screwdriver).

We discuss how he navigated visa setbacks, chose not to take on the founder title, and ultimately led a growing biotech startup through fundraising, scaling, and exit. Along the way, he learned how to stop acting like what was expected of him and instead built a career that played to his real strengths.

This episode is about learning to work with your brain, not against it – and realising that sometimes, you're not the wrong tool, you're just in the wrong toolbox.
