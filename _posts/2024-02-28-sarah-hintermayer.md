Sarah Hintermayer is Vice President of regional strategy at Evonik, founder of a food venture, and lecturer on entrepreneurship in biotech at the University of Bielefeld. After completing her PhD in biotechnology, she worked as a process engineer at Evonik, a specialty chemicals company focussing on concrete.

Sarah then transitioned to become a corporate entrepreneur (intrapreneur). She continuously moved within the company, motivated by teamwork. This brought her from managing products on self-healing concrete to personal healthcare products, and eventually to a role as head of regional strategy.
